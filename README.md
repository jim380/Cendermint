## Disclaimer

This project started out as a fork of [Cosmos-IE](https://github.com/node-a-team/Cosmos-IE) by [Node A-Team](https://github.com/node-a-team). I'd like to express my greatest gratitude and appreciation to them for initiating and open-sourcing their awesome work. Since the fork it has undergone a few significant rewrites, refactors and design changes. Though semi-stable, Cendermint is still very much a work-in-progress so please proceed with caution.

## Get Up and Running

### Build from Source

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/githb.com
$ git clone https://github.com/jim380/Cendermint.git
$ cd $HOME/Cendermint
$ go build
# Important!!! Remember to fill out config.env

```

### Docker

#### Local Dev

```bash
$ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose build cendermint --no-cache
$ docker compose up -d
$ docker-compose down
```

#### Deploy

```bash
$ docker run --name cendermint -dt --restart on-failure -v <your_dir>:/root --net="host" --env-file ./config.env ghcr.io/jim380/cendermint:<tag> Cendermint run && docker logs cendermint -f --since 1m
```

Again, remember to create a `config.env` under `<your_dir>` and have it filled out.
