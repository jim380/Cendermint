A governance proposal is only considered eligible for voting by the whole validator set if a certain amount of staking token is deposited on the proposal. The intention is that the deposit will be burned if a proposal is spam or has caused a negative externality to the Cosmos community (such as wasting stakeholders’ time having to review the proposal).\n\nIn the current implementation of the governance module used in the Cosmos Hub, the deposit is burned if a proposal does not pass, regardless of how close the final tally result may have been. For example, if 49% of stake votes in favor of a proposal while 51% votes against it, the deposit will still be burned. This seems to be an undesirable behavior as it disincentivizes anyone from creating or depositing on a proposal that might be slightly contentious but not spam, due to fear of losing the deposit minimum (currently 512 atoms). This will especially be the case as TextProposals will be used for signaling purposes, to gauge the sentiment of staked Atom holders. Disincentivizing proposals for which the outcome is uncertain would undermine that effort.\n\nWe instead propose that the deposit be returned on failed votes, and that the deposit only be burned on vetoed votes. If a proposal seems to be spam or is deemed to have caused a negative externality to Cosmos communninty, voters should vote NoWithVeto on the proposal. If \u003E33% of the stake chooses to Veto a proposal, the deposits will then be burned. However, if a proposal gets rejected without being vetoed, the deposits should be returned to the depositors.

We deem the issue to be of high severity, as if exploited it can potentially degrade the security model of the chain's Proof of Stake system.  This vulnerability CANNOT lead to the theft of Atoms or creation of Atoms out of thin air. \n\n All in Bits has released a source code patch, Gaia v0.34.6, that closes the exploitable code path starting at block 482100. \n\n The proposed upgrade code Git hash is:  80234baf91a15dd9a7df8dca38677b66b8d148c1 \n\n As a proof of stake, we are putting some collateral behind this legitimacy of this bug and patch and encourage others familiar with the report to do so as well.  If the disclosed bug turns out to be fabricated or malicious in some way, we urge the Cosmos Hub governance to slash these Atoms by voting NoWithVeto on this proposal. \n\n We encourage validators and all users to upgrade their nodes to Gaia v0.34.6 before block 482100.  In the absence of another public bulletin board, we request validators to please vote Yes on this proposal AFTER they have upgraded their nodes to v0.34.6, as a method of signalling the readiness of the network for the upgrade."

      "title": "Notification for Security Critical Hard Fork at Block 482100",
      "summary": "As described by user @Jessysaurusrex on Cosmos Forum in https://forum.cosmos.network/t/critical-cosmossdk-security-advisory/2211, All in Bits has learned of a critical security vulnerability in the codebase for the Cosmos Hub.  We deem the issue to be of high severity, as if exploited it can potentially degrade the security model of the chain's Proof of Stake system.  This vulnerability CANNOT lead to the theft of Atoms or creation of Atoms out of thin air. \n\n All in Bits has released a source code patch, Gaia v0.34.6, that closes the exploitable code path starting at block 482100. \n\n The proposed upgrade code Git hash is:  80234baf91a15dd9a7df8dca38677b66b8d148c1 \n\n As a proof of stake, we are putting some collateral behind this legitimacy of this bug and patch and encourage others familiar with the report to do so as well.  If the disclosed bug turns out to be fabricated or malicious in some way, we urge the Cosmos Hub governance to slash these Atoms by voting NoWithVeto on this proposal. \n\n We encourage validators and all users to upgrade their nodes to Gaia v0.34.6 before block 482100.  In the absence of another public bulletin board, we request validators to please vote Yes on this proposal AFTER they have upgraded their nodes to v0.34.6, as a method of signalling the readiness of the network for the upgrade.",

This number was originally proposed in the Cosmos whitepaper section titled [Limitations on the Number of Validators](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#limitations-on-the-number-of-validators 4). This number was chosen as a relatively conservative estimate, as at the time of writing, it was unclear how many widely distributed nodes Tendermint consensus could scale to over the public internet.  \n\nHowever, since then, we have seen empirically through the running of the Game of Stakes incentivized testnet that Tendermint Core with Gaia state machine can operate with over 180 validators at reasonable average block times of \u003C7 seconds. The Game of Stakes results empirically show that adding validators should not delay consensus at small block sizes. At large block sizes, the time it takes for the block to gossip to all validators may increase depending on the newfound network topology. However we view this as unlikely, and if it did become a problem, it could later be solved by known improvements at the p2p layer. The other tradeoff to increasing the number of validators is that the size of commits becomes ~25% larger due to more precommits being included, increasing the network and storage costs for nodes. This can also be resolved in the future with the integration of aggregate signatures. At the time of submission of this proposal, the minimum delegation to become a top 100 validator is 30,600 Atoms, a fairly high barrier to entry for new validators looking to enter the active validator set.  \n\nIn the Cosmos whitepaper, it states that the number of validators on the Hub will increase at a rate of 13% a year until it hits a cap of 300 validators. We propose scrapping this mechanism and instead increasing the max validators to 125 validators in the next chain upgrade with no further planned increases. Future increases to the validator set size will be originated through governance."
